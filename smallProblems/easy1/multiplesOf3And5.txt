Problem: Return the sum of all numbers that are multiples of 3 and 5 that are between 1 and some other number. Assume the other number is an integer greater than 1

Example: multisum(3);       // 3
multisum(5);       // 8
multisum(10);      // 33
multisum(1000);    // 234168

Data Structure: Input: one integer, output: one integer

Algorithm:
Initiate an empty array
Loop from 1 until n:
	check whether a number is divisible by 3 and 5:
		add it to an array

Loop through the numbers array using .reduce method and get one number that sums the numbers in that array
Return the answer
