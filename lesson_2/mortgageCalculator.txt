Problem: Calculate the monthly interest rate and loan duration in months given the loan amount, the annual percentage rate (APR) and the loan duration.

Use the formula below: let m = p * (j / (1 - Math.pow ((1+j), (-n))));

Assume the loan amount is in dollars and the annual percentage rate is in percentage ex. 5%, the loan duration input is in years entered as three separate variables.

Examples:
Input: 500000, 5, 30
Output: 2684.11, 360

Input: 0, 5, 30
Output: 0, 0

Input: -500000, 5, 30
Output: Invalid

Input: 500000, 100, 30
Output: 41,666.67, 360

Input: 500000, 0, 30
Output: 1388.89, 360

Input: 500000, -5, 30
Output: invalid interest rate

Input: 500000, 5, 0
Output: 500000

Input: 500000, 5, -4
Output: Invalid

Data Structures:
3 Strings as input

2 numbers as output

Algorithm:

START

#Given three different strings as LOANAMOUNT, APR, LOANLENGTHINYEARS

SET loanInMonths = LOANLENGTHINYEARS * 12

SET monthlyINTEREST = APR / 12

SET monthPayment = LOANAMOUNT * (monthlyInterest / (1 - Math.pow((1 + monthlyInterest), (-loanMonths))))

PRINT loanInMonths, monthPayment
